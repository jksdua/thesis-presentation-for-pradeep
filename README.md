## Research Proposal - Presentation for Pradeep

#### Title:
Impact of personalisation in tailored mobile consumer health systems

#### Background:
- Tailoring refers to any number of methods for creating individualised communications to modify behavioral determinants
- National Cancer Institute has invested $150 million in tailored communication research

#### Need for the study:
- Current literature on tailoring looks at it as a black box (unitrary construct)
  - It does not de-construct the different constructs of tailoring which affect behavior change
	- Hawkins 2008 recommends looking at the individual constructs that impact tailoring outcomes for future researchers
- Previous literature provides constructs that create a tailored experience and recommends researching the impact of these contructs individually on behavioral change

##### Purpose and aims of the study:
- Look at how the construct of personalisation impacts behavior change leading to better health outcomes in the context of mobile consumer health
- Systematic review of current mobile applications reveals less than 6% meet personalisation criteria
	- Personalisation is easiest to add, does not require an intelligent system

###### Research question
1. How does the costruct of personalisation within tailoring impact behavioral outcomes?

#### Literature review:
##### Methodology
Systematic review using Kitchenham's formula

##### Tailored health systems
- Most systems focus on push based personalised messages using SMS
- 10 studies identified in previous literature that focuses on tailoring
	- 8 reported behavior change based on tailored interventions
	- Smoking cesation studies report significantly greater success rate

##### Tailoring constructs
- Personalisation
	- Gives the perception that information is tailored to the user
	- Placebo effect
	- Agreed by various literature
- Feedback/content matching
	- Some literature treats as one while other breaks it up into two different constructs
	- Intelligently matching content based on theoretical grounding and to user's needs

##### Behaviour change constructs
- Self-efficacy

#### Research design:
- Health belief model
	- Used and proposed by previous literature
	- 

- Alternative approaches used in literature
	- I-Change and stages of change
		- Used for measuring effectiveness of tailoring over time compared to non-tailored content
		- Proves that tailored systems are able to adjust to unplanned progress and regress
		- Personalisation levels are not impacted by stages of a user or an intervention program

#### Timetable:
	- July & August - Instrument construction
	- September & October - Data collection

#### Contribution:
- Help deconstruct the black box of tailoring in consumer health
- Add to existing tailoring literature
